## Description

My motavation for and thoughout this seeming to be amazing course was finding my pourpose. As a "high dollar car" techinion I knew that I had some much more potential. hense I came accross coding, seeing my changes in VS work on an acual page facanacted me. It was something that made me happy and though that planning to work in the feild it was something that I knew would brighten my feature. 
I didn't complete this task simply because it was a 'task'. I compleated this task because it made me grow, learn and see that what i'm doing has an actual change. Not just on screen but to me as a person in general. It made me belive that I wasn't stuck in a industry that didn't make me happy. That I had a chance to love what I do for a living.
For me this solves a lot of problems personaly but course wise it helps in ways you wouldn't think "PreWork" would. It showed you how to start from scratch and that you could do it no matter what the issue is. Weather that be thoughout debugging an issue or just adding more on so everything works seemily.
I learned an array of things from this work that I was set on compleating. From something as basic as what HTML and CSS are all the way to debugging a loop that wasn't closed out correctly.

## Usage

During my work in this course there were many things to learn, look over, and go back on. During the first moduel there were very helpful things that even though are basic are the building blocks of everything you will need to know. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were gone over extensively during the course. Even just being an intruduction to debugging in mod one, it gave you an idea on what you would be taking on.Module two explains things like the four cornerstones and aglie Manifesto. It introduces you to the command line why you need to rely on it and the Terminal. It explains that SSH keys allow developers to interface with certain services without having to type in a password over and over again. Teaches you that a bottleneck isn't just the neck of a bottle yet something from one point will slow down the flow of everything you do after. Module three explains to us that delecrations contain more then one thing that will be important componets in the CSS proptery. Makes us as students understand that 'console.log' will output a message ny adding arguements. How an array can sustain a a group of data while just beiing by itself. That when filpping though more then one line of code we can use the loop feature to speed the peocess up and just put 'x+1' to increase our line of code to the next.
